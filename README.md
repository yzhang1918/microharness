# easyharness

Harnesses matter. Building one shouldn't be the project.

`easyharness` is a git-native, agent-first harness for human-steered,
agent-executed work. It packages repo-local instructions, plans, workflow
state, review, and archive paths into a thin system that coding agents can
actually follow, so humans can steer work without maintaining a heavy custom
harness from scratch.

The project is named `easyharness`. The CLI executable remains `harness`.

## Why easyharness

Long-running agent work gets fragile when plans, state, and rules live only in
chat history or ad hoc shell scripts. Agents lose coherence, humans end up
micromanaging implementation details, and the workflow becomes hard to inspect
or teach to the next run.

`easyharness` keeps the important parts of the workflow in the repository:

- repo-local instructions and skills that tell the agent how to work here
- git-tracked plans and durable summaries that survive context loss
- command-owned workflow state, review artifacts, and evidence under `.local/`
- a steering surface built around plans, status, and execution summaries

The goal is not to make humans read every diff by default. The goal is to make
it easy for humans to set direction, approve intent, inspect high-signal
artifacts, and intervene when judgment is needed.

## Quickstart

Install `easyharness` with Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap catu-ai/tap
brew install easyharness
```

Bootstrap a repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-repo
harness init
```

`harness init` installs the managed `AGENTS.md` block and repo-local
`.agents/skills/` pack that tell your coding agent how to work in that
repository. After running it, restart your coding agent so it picks up the new
instructions and skills cleanly. In practice, that is the point where the
repository starts telling the agent what it needs to know.

When you or the agent need the current workflow position, use:

```bash
harness status
```

When a human wants the main built-in steering surface, use:

```bash
harness ui
```

`harness ui` starts the local read-only harness workbench. It is the primary
UI for human steering: the place to inspect the current plan, workflow status,
and execution summaries without reconstructing the story from shell history.

## Stability

`easyharness` is evolving quickly, and breaking changes may happen between
releases.

That does not mean the human operator needs to track every internal workflow
detail by hand. The harness is designed so agents can recover the relevant
context from repo-local instructions, plans, workflow state, and skills, then
continue the work intentionally.

The product should keep evolving in the same direction:

- trust agents as collaborators by default
- reduce agent cognitive load
- prefer workflow clarity over pseudo-verification
- improve execution quality and legibility
- help humans steer the work without micromanaging it

When developing `easyharness` core itself, keep the system honest about that
trust boundary. Prefer lighter workflow cues that help agents stay on track
over anti-cheating or pseudo-verification mechanics that add ceremony without
creating a real trust surface.

## How Humans Steer

In an `easyharness` repository, the human role is to steer the work, not to
micromanage every implementation step.

In practice that means:

- define intent, scope, constraints, and non-goals
- approve or adjust plans before execution starts
- review execution summaries, outcomes, and high-signal artifacts
- step in when product, risk, or judgment calls matter
- avoid treating success as manually reviewing every changed line by default

The repository workflow is built around that posture:

1. Discovery
2. Plan
3. Execute
4. Archive / publish / await merge approval
5. Land

## Workflow Surface

The current v0.2 harness surface centers on a few core ideas:

- tracked plans live under `docs/plans/`
- command-owned runtime state, reviews, and evidence live under
  `.local/harness/`
- the CLI reports one canonical `state.current_node`
- `harness ui` is the main built-in human steering surface for the workflow
- agents use repo-local skills instead of reconstructing workflow from shell
  history

The root CLI currently ships:

- `harness plan template`
- `harness plan lint`
- `harness init`
- `harness skills install`
- `harness skills uninstall`
- `harness instructions install`
- `harness instructions uninstall`
- `harness execute start`
- `harness evidence submit`
- `harness status`
- `harness ui`
- `harness review start`
- `harness review submit`
- `harness review aggregate`
- `harness archive`
- `harness reopen --mode <finalize-fix|new-step>`
- `harness land --pr <url> [--commit <sha>]`
- `harness land complete`

The root CLI also exposes `harness --version` as a JSON-first binary identity
probe. Release binaries keep that payload concise for consumers, while dev
binaries may expose extra debug-oriented fields such as the resolved binary
path.

## Releases

`easyharness` ships through GitHub Releases and a dedicated Homebrew tap.
Supported release targets are:

- `darwin/amd64`
- `darwin/arm64`
- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`

Typical verification flow:

- macOS: `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS`
- Linux: `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`

To inspect a release archive directly:

```bash
unzip easyharness_<version>_<goos>_<goarch>.zip
cd easyharness_<version>_<goos>_<goarch>
./harness --version
./harness --help
```

`./harness --version` now returns JSON. For release binaries, expect the core
identity fields such as `version`, `mode`, and `commit`, with optional extra
metadata such as `go_version` or `build_time` when the binary can report them.

Maintainers cut releases from a dedicated release PR that updates the root
`VERSION` file plus any related release docs. `VERSION` stores the unprefixed
release version such as `0.0.0`; after that PR merges to `main`, automation
creates the matching `v*` tag and dispatches the `Release` workflow, which
publishes the release assets for that tag and updates the Homebrew formula when
the tap token is configured.

## For Contributors

This repository is developed primarily through agents.

When changing `easyharness` itself, keep the framework trust-based and
agent-first. New prompts, commands, or workflow surfaces should make the agent
easier to guide and less likely to drift, not turn the core harness into an
identity-verification system or a pile of extra ceremony.

Repo-specific operating guidance lives in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md). Detailed
local development and maintainer setup lives in
[docs/development.md](./docs/development.md). Durable CLI and workflow
contracts live in [docs/specs/index.md](./docs/specs/index.md), and the
checked-in schema registry lives in [schema/index.json](./schema/index.json).
