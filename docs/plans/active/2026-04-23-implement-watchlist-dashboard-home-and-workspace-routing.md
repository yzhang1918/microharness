# Implement Watchlist Dashboard Home And Workspace Routing

<!-- This plan uses supplements/2026-04-23-implement-watchlist-dashboard-home-and-workspace-routing/
to carry the accepted dashboard visual reference and design comments that
future execution should treat as part of the approved plan package. Before
archive, any repository-facing contract changes must be absorbed into tracked
docs or code so the supplement remains backup context rather than a hidden
dependency. -->

## Goal

Turn the machine-local watchlist read model into a usable dashboard product
surface. This slice should add the `harness dashboard` entrypoint, implement
the dashboard home at `/dashboard`, support workspace detail routing under
`/workspace/<workspace_key>/...`, and let the user remove watchlist membership
with `Unwatch` without mutating harness workflow state.

The result should feel like the home/explorer for the same product family as
the existing workspace workbench, not a separate SaaS-style dashboard. The
dashboard home should be a flat recency-sorted list that emphasizes
workspace/folder name, long plan title, current state, and a compact progress
signal while preserving straightforward navigation into the existing dense
single-workspace workbench.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Add a top-level `harness dashboard` command that starts the local UI server
  and opens the machine-local dashboard home at `/dashboard`.
- Redirect `/` to `/dashboard`.
- Implement workspace detail routes under
  `/workspace/<workspace_key>/status|plan|timeline|review` and redirect bare
  `/workspace/<workspace_key>` to `/workspace/<workspace_key>/status`.
- Keep `harness ui` as a compatibility entrypoint in this slice without
  printing a deprecation warning; it should continue to open the current
  workspace, but through the new dashboard-owned workspace route.
- Ensure `harness ui` can reach the current workspace detail by touching the
  current workdir into the machine-local watchlist before opening the route.
- Build the dashboard home as one recency-sorted stacked list using
  `last_seen_at`, not lifecycle-grouped sections.
- Reuse the existing workspace workbench shell for readable watched workspaces
  and add a `Home` affordance in the rail that returns to `/dashboard`.
- Render missing, invalid, and not-currently-watched workspace routes through
  one intentionally minimal degraded page with a return path to the dashboard.
- Wire `Unwatch` as the one dashboard-local write action and keep it scoped to
  watchlist membership removal only.
- Align tracked docs with the accepted home-layout, routing, compatibility, and
  `Unwatch` behavior changes where current wording still implies grouped home
  sections or a deprecation warning in this slice.
- Persist the accepted dashboard design reference and comments in the matching
  tracked supplements package so future execution does not depend on discovery
  chat.

### Out of Scope

- Search, filters, saved views, or any other dashboard browsing controls beyond
  recency order.
- Notifications, background monitoring, filesystem watching, or daemon/server
  reuse across command runs.
- Cross-worktree write actions other than explicit `Unwatch`.
- A richer degraded workspace experience beyond a simple shared minimal page.
- Mobile-specific redesign work beyond choosing a dashboard item structure that
  can collapse vertically without redesigning the whole page.
- Reworking the existing status/plan/timeline/review content model inside the
  workspace workbench.
- New progress semantics such as percent-complete math or speculative
  session/activity counts not backed by a stable product definition.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `harness dashboard` opens the UI at `/dashboard`, and `/` redirects to
      `/dashboard`.
- [ ] The dashboard home renders watched workspaces as one stacked list sorted
      by `last_seen_at` descending instead of lifecycle-grouped sections.
- [ ] Each dashboard item visibly prioritizes workspace/folder name, plan
      title, status, recency, and compact path/meta information using the
      accepted design direction captured in the supplements package.
- [ ] Dashboard items use a fixed-width progress axis whose node count varies
      with the underlying workflow data rather than a generic fixed-slot
      template.
- [ ] `/workspace/<workspace_key>` redirects to
      `/workspace/<workspace_key>/status`, and readable watched workspaces load
      the existing workbench under the new route family.
- [ ] The workspace-detail rail includes `Home`, which returns the user to the
      dashboard home.
- [ ] `harness ui` still works in this slice, opens the current workspace via
      the new route family, and does so without printing a deprecation warning.
- [ ] Missing, invalid, and unknown workspace keys share one intentionally
      minimal degraded page with a return path to the dashboard; `Unwatch`
      appears only when the workspace is still in the watchlist.
- [ ] `Unwatch` removes watchlist membership only and does not call
      `harness archive`, mutate tracked plans, or change workflow state.
- [ ] Tracked docs and tests capture the accepted routing, compatibility, and
      dashboard-home behavior without relying on discovery chat.

## Deferred Items

- Search, filtering, and other dashboard browsing affordances.
- Richer degraded-page content or route-specific recovery flows.
- More expressive progress-node hover/focus UI beyond the minimal baseline.
- Any stable aggregate activity metric such as concurrent sessions; this slice
  should prefer already-defined signals like warnings, review state, or step
  counts.
- A later decision on when `harness ui` should begin printing a deprecation
  warning.

## Work Breakdown

### Step 1: Align the tracked dashboard contract and preserve the design baseline

- Done: [x]

#### Objective

Update tracked docs and plan supplements so a future agent can implement the
agreed dashboard without re-reading discovery chat.

#### Details

The tracked design/package for this slice should record the accepted
differences from the older issue/spec wording: the dashboard home is a flat
recency-sorted list rather than grouped lifecycle sections, `Unwatch` is
allowed as the one dashboard-local write action, and `harness ui` stays quiet
in this slice instead of printing a deprecation warning. The supplement should
carry the approved dashboard reference image plus explicit comments describing
what to preserve, what not to literal-copy, and which earlier mockup ideas were
rejected.

#### Expected Files

- `docs/specs/proposals/harness-ui-steering-surface.md`
- `docs/specs/watchlist-contract.md`
- `docs/plans/active/2026-04-23-implement-watchlist-dashboard-home-and-workspace-routing.md`
- `docs/plans/active/supplements/2026-04-23-implement-watchlist-dashboard-home-and-workspace-routing/dashboard-home-reference.png`
- `docs/plans/active/supplements/2026-04-23-implement-watchlist-dashboard-home-and-workspace-routing/dashboard-home-reference.md`

#### Validation

- Reread the updated spec sections against this plan and confirm that grouped
  home sections and an immediate `harness ui` deprecation warning are no longer
  described as required behavior for this slice.
- Run `git diff --check -- docs/specs/proposals/harness-ui-steering-surface.md docs/specs/watchlist-contract.md docs/plans/active/2026-04-23-implement-watchlist-dashboard-home-and-workspace-routing.md docs/plans/active/supplements/2026-04-23-implement-watchlist-dashboard-home-and-workspace-routing/dashboard-home-reference.md`.

#### Execution Notes

Updated the tracked routing and dashboard-home contract to match the approved
slice: `docs/specs/proposals/harness-ui-steering-surface.md` now describes
`/dashboard`, the `/workspace/<workspace_key>/status|plan|timeline|review`
family, redirect behavior for `/` and bare workspace routes, and the quiet
`harness ui` compatibility path for this release. `docs/specs/watchlist-contract.md`
now records that the stable grouped read model may be flattened by the first
dashboard home into one recency-sorted list. The plan supplement package now
carries the accepted dashboard reference image plus explicit comments about the
stacked-slab layout, the fixed-width variable-density progress axis, the lack
of dashboard left rail, and the rejection of speculative `x sessions` copy.

Validated with a direct reread of the updated spec sections against the active
plan and `git diff --check -- docs/specs/proposals/harness-ui-steering-surface.md docs/specs/watchlist-contract.md docs/plans/active/2026-04-23-implement-watchlist-dashboard-home-and-workspace-routing.md docs/plans/active/supplements/2026-04-23-implement-watchlist-dashboard-home-and-workspace-routing/dashboard-home-reference.md`.

#### Review Notes

NO_STEP_REVIEW_NEEDED: the contract and supplement edits were developed as part
of one integrated dashboard slice, so a separate Step 1 review boundary would
be artificial; the full candidate review will cover these tracked docs together
with the runtime implementation they define.

### Step 2: Add the dashboard entrypoint and route-aware UI server behavior

- Done: [x]

#### Objective

Teach the CLI and UI server to own the machine-local dashboard home, workspace
detail routes, degraded-route handling, and watchlist-backed compatibility
launches from `harness ui`.

#### Details

This step should add the new CLI entrypoint, preserve `harness ui` as a
compatibility command, and give the server enough route-aware backend behavior
to serve dashboard and per-workspace UI resources from one process. The
implementation should prefer read-time resolution from the watchlist/dashboard
model over ad hoc hardcoding, and it should keep `Unwatch` scoped to the
watchlist service. The compatibility path for `harness ui` should touch the
current workdir into the watchlist before opening the matching workspace route
so the new route family stays the single workspace-detail surface.

#### Expected Files

- `internal/cli/app.go`
- `internal/cli/app_test.go`
- `internal/ui/server.go`
- `internal/ui/server_test.go`
- helper files under `internal/ui/` or `internal/dashboard/` if route-key
  lookup or route resource loading needs to be shared cleanly

#### Validation

- Add or update CLI tests for `harness dashboard`, `/` redirection behavior,
  and `harness ui` compatibility routing.
- Add or update UI server tests for dashboard reads, workspace route handling,
  degraded routes, and `Unwatch` request handling.
- Run focused Go tests covering the touched CLI/UI packages.

#### Execution Notes

Added a dashboard-owned launch and routing surface across the CLI and UI
server. `internal/cli/app.go` now exposes `harness dashboard`, keeps
`harness ui` as a quiet compatibility entrypoint, touches the current workdir
into the watchlist before `harness ui` opens `/workspace/<key>/status`, and
lets tests assert the exact browser path via an injected `RunUIServer`
function. `internal/ui/server.go` now redirects `/` to `/dashboard`,
redirects bare `/workspace/<key>` routes to `/workspace/<key>/status`, serves
the SPA shell for dashboard and workspace routes, resolves watched workspaces
by key for per-workspace API reads, and scopes `POST /api/workspace/<key>/unwatch`
to watchlist membership removal. `internal/dashboard/service.go` and
`internal/contracts/dashboard.go` now expose per-workspace lookup data
including workspace name, plan title, status facts, and a truthful progress
axis derived from tracked plan structure plus finalize/await-merge nodes.

Validated with targeted unit coverage in `internal/dashboard/service_test.go`,
`internal/ui/server_test.go`, and `internal/cli/app_test.go`, plus
`go test ./internal/dashboard ./internal/ui ./internal/cli -count=1` and the
later branch-wide `go test ./... -count=1`.

#### Review Notes

NO_STEP_REVIEW_NEEDED: this CLI/server/runtime wiring is tightly coupled to the
frontend route ownership and is safer to review as one integrated candidate
than as an isolated pre-UI backend slice.

### Step 3: Build the dashboard home, workspace route shell changes, and minimal degraded page

- Done: [ ]

#### Objective

Implement the dashboard frontend, reuse the existing workbench under the new
workspace routes, and wire the accepted minimal `Unwatch`/degraded UI.

#### Details

The dashboard home should follow the supplement comments: no left rail, no
outer section box, and no consumer-SaaS card grid. Each item should present
workspace/folder name first, then plan title, then path/meta, then a fixed
width progress axis whose node count comes from actual workflow data rather
than a fake shared slot template. Long plan titles should be allowed to read
as the main secondary content, including a controlled two-line presentation if
needed. The workspace-detail rail should gain `Home`, while the detail content
should otherwise keep the existing status/plan/timeline/review model.

For degraded and unknown workspace routes, keep the page intentionally minimal:
plain summary, route context, `Return to dashboard`, and `Unwatch` only when
the key still resolves to a watched workspace entry.

#### Expected Files

- `web/src/main.tsx`
- `web/src/types.ts`
- `web/src/helpers.ts`
- `web/src/pages.tsx`
- `web/src/workbench.tsx`
- `web/src/styles.css`
- additional `web/src/` files if the route split is cleaner with new
  components

#### Validation

- Add or update frontend tests if the repository already has stable coverage at
  this layer; otherwise ensure `pnpm --dir web build` passes.
- Run targeted server/UI tests that exercise the dashboard home, workspace
  routes, degraded page, and `Unwatch` flow end-to-end through the local UI
  server.
- If practical during execution, capture fresh screenshots proving the final
  dashboard stays aligned with the supplement reference and current workbench
  shell.

#### Execution Notes

Reworked the frontend into a dashboard-owned route model without adding a
router library. `web/src/main.tsx` now parses `/dashboard` and
`/workspace/<key>/<page>` centrally, fetches `/api/dashboard` plus
workspace-keyed resources, routes readable workspaces through the existing
workbench shell, and sends degraded or unknown keys to one minimal fallback
page. `web/src/pages.tsx`, `web/src/helpers.ts`, `web/src/types.ts`, and
`web/src/styles.css` now implement the accepted dashboard home: one recency-
sorted stacked list, no dashboard left rail, folder/workspace name first, plan
title allowed to occupy the main secondary space, path/meta underneath, a
fixed-width progress axis whose node count comes from actual workflow data,
and weak `Open` / `Unwatch` actions. `web/src/workbench.tsx` now supports a
`Home` rail icon so workspace detail can return directly to `/dashboard`.

Step-closeout `review-001-full` then requested six repairs across correctness,
tests, and repo-facing docs. The repair extracted `useLiveResource` into a
dedicated module and resets resource state on path changes so workspace-route
navigation cannot keep rendering the previous workspace after a missing,
invalid, or unwatched lookup. Dashboard list rows now use a collision-safe
client key derived from `workspace_key`, `workspace_path`, and index. CLI
coverage now proves `harness ui` touches the current workspace into the
machine-local watchlist before opening its keyed route. UI server coverage now
exercises keyed `/plan`, `/timeline`, and `/review` reads in addition to
keyed `/status`. The web package now has targeted Vitest coverage for live-
resource path resets, dashboard progress-node rendering, degraded-page action
behavior, and collision-safe dashboard row keys. Repo-facing docs now present
`harness dashboard` as the dashboard home and `harness ui` as the quiet
current-workspace compatibility entrypoint, and `scripts/sync-contract-artifacts`
was rerun so the generated dashboard schema stays in sync with the updated Go
contract.

Validated with `go test ./internal/dashboard ./internal/ui ./internal/cli -count=1`,
`pnpm --dir web test`, `pnpm --dir web build`,
`scripts/sync-contract-artifacts --check`, and `go test ./... -count=1`.

Delta `review-002-delta` then found one remaining correctness gap: dashboard
collision rows rendered distinctly, but `Unwatch` still targeted only
`/api/workspace/<workspace_key>/unwatch`, so a colliding key could remove a
different watched workspace than the row the user clicked. The repair now
posts the exact `workspace_path` from the selected row, and the server now
resolves unwatch targets fail-safe: when a request omits `workspace_path`, a
colliding key returns an ambiguity error instead of removing an arbitrary
match. Added targeted server coverage for explicit-path unwatchs and helper
coverage for the ambiguous collision case. Revalidated with
`go test ./internal/ui ./internal/cli -count=1`, `pnpm --dir web test`, and
`pnpm --dir web build`.

#### Review Notes

`review-001-full` requested six blocking findings. Correctness found that
workspace-route changes could keep rendering stale workspace data across key
changes and that dashboard collision rows used duplicate client keys.
Tests found missing coverage for the `harness ui` watchlist-touch
compatibility contract, keyed workspace `/plan|timeline|review` reads, and
frontend-only degraded/progress behavior. Docs consistency found that the
README and normative CLI contract still described `harness ui` as the primary
UI surface instead of documenting `harness dashboard` plus the quiet
compatibility role for `harness ui`.

All six findings are now repaired and revalidated. Fresh delta review is the
next step before marking Step 3 done. `review-002-delta` then cleared tests
and docs consistency but raised one additional correctness finding: collision
rows still sent an ambiguous unwatch target. That repair is now in place and a
fresh narrow delta review is the next step.

## Validation Strategy

- Lint the tracked plan before approval.
- Recheck the plan plus supplement package as if the chat history were gone and
  confirm a future agent could implement the accepted UX from repository files
  alone.
- During execution, keep validation focused on CLI/UI server tests, dashboard
  route coverage, and a passing `pnpm --dir web build`.
- Before archive, confirm any accepted routing or home-layout contract changes
  have been written back into tracked specs so the supplement remains a design
  aid rather than a hidden dependency.

## Risks

- Risk: The dashboard could drift into a separate visual product and stop
  feeling like the home of the existing workbench.
  - Mitigation: Keep the accepted reference image and comments in the approved
    supplement package, and align any necessary spec wording with that
    baseline.
- Risk: The progress axis could become a misleading fake template rather than a
  truthful rendering of workflow structure.
  - Mitigation: Treat the fixed axis width as a layout constraint only; derive
    node count from actual workflow/plan data and avoid invented percent or
    session math.
- Risk: `harness ui` compatibility could accidentally create a second
  workspace-detail product surface.
  - Mitigation: Route both `harness dashboard` and `harness ui` into the same
    `/workspace/<workspace_key>/...` family and test that compatibility path
    explicitly.
