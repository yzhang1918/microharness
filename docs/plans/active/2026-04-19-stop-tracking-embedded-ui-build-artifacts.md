# Stop Tracking Embedded UI Build Artifacts

## Goal

Treat `internal/ui/generated/build/` as the canonical generated embed output
for this repository, with frontend source under `web/` as the tracked input
and contributor/automation flows responsible for rebuilding assets locally and
in CI/release before Go compilation. This replaces the earlier practice of
checking generated UI bundles into git under `internal/ui/static/`, so UI pull
requests should primarily review source edits under `web/` plus any supporting
scripts/tests/docs.

The shipped `harness` binary should remain self-contained for end users. The
contract change applies to repository contributors and automation, not to
people installing released binaries.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Keep generated embed output under `internal/ui/generated/build/` while
  removing the old practice of tracking bundle files under `internal/ui/static/`
  in git.
- Update developer bootstrap so `scripts/install-dev-harness` prepares frontend
  dependencies/build output and fails with actionable guidance when `node` or
  `pnpm` is missing.
- Update CI and release automation so frontend assets are built before Go
  tests/builds consume embedded UI assets.
- Update docs and smoke/workflow tests so the new contract is explicit and
  remains stable.

### Out of Scope

- Replacing Vite, Preact, or the current embedded-UI architecture.
- Making `harness ui` itself auto-install Node dependencies or silently rebuild
  the frontend on demand.
- Broader frontend refactors unrelated to the artifact-tracking contract.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The repository no longer tracks generated UI bundle files under
      `internal/ui/generated/build/`, and UI changes are reviewed primarily via
      source files plus workflow/script changes.
- [x] `scripts/install-dev-harness` prepares the embedded UI assets as part of
      developer bootstrap and stops with clear installation guidance when
      required frontend tooling is missing.
- [x] CI and release automation build the frontend before `go test` or release
      packaging so the released `harness` binary still embeds working UI
      assets.
- [x] Documentation and smoke/workflow tests describe and validate the new
      developer/build contract without relying on hidden chat context.

## Deferred Items

- Automatic fallback rebuilds from inside `harness ui` itself if generated UI
  assets are missing at runtime.

## Work Breakdown

### Step 1: Establish the generated embedded-UI contract

- Done: [x]

#### Objective

Define one clean repository contract for embedded UI assets: frontend source is
tracked, generated bundles are not, and Go build/test flows consume generated
assets from a known location.

#### Details

Remove the current practice of checking minified Vite output into git while
preserving the existing embedded UI serving model. The execution path should
keep one canonical build output location for the embedded assets, update git
tracking/ignore rules accordingly, and leave future agents with a clear answer
for how a clean checkout becomes buildable again.

#### Expected Files

- `.gitignore`
- `internal/ui/server.go`
- `internal/ui/generated/`
- `web/vite.config.ts`

#### Validation

- A clean worktree no longer shows generated UI bundle files as tracked source.
- The chosen output location still works with the embedded server contract once
  assets have been generated.
- Any tracked-file deletions or ignore rules are deliberate and documented in
  the plan execution notes.

#### Execution Notes

Moved the Vite build output from tracked `internal/ui/static/` into generated
`internal/ui/generated/build/`, switched `go:embed` to the generated root, and
left a tracked README anchor so clean checkouts still have a stable embed path.
TDD note: this slice changed a shared workflow contract across build scripts,
fixtures, docs, and embedded assets, so strict Red/Green by micro-step was not
practical; focused validation and repo-level smoke coverage were used instead.
After `review-001-full` requested changes, the repair pass moved the
Playwright smoke scripts onto `scripts/build-embedded-ui`, added an explicit
`node` preflight ahead of `pnpm`, cleared inherited generated assets from the
installer/release checkout fixtures, and tightened workflow smoke assertions so
they verify build-before-test and build-before-package ordering directly.

#### Review Notes

PASSED via `review-001-full` follow-up repair and `review-002-delta` on
2026-04-19. The initial full closeout review requested five blocking fixes
around shared builder usage, missing-`node` guidance, clean-checkout smoke
proof, and workflow-order assertions; the repair commit addressed those items
and the delta follow-up passed with zero findings.

### Step 2: Update local developer bootstrap and failure modes

- Done: [x]

#### Objective

Make `scripts/install-dev-harness` the supported local bootstrap path for both
the Go binary and generated embedded UI assets.

#### Details

The installer should prepare frontend dependencies/build output before building
the repo-local `harness` binary, and it should stop early with concise guidance
when required tools such as `node` or `pnpm` are unavailable. Any installer
tests that currently assume Go-only bootstrap need to absorb the frontend build
contract and cover the new failure messaging.

#### Expected Files

- `scripts/install-dev-harness`
- `tests/smoke/install_dev_harness_test.go`
- `docs/development.md`

#### Validation

- Running `scripts/install-dev-harness` in a prepared environment produces both
  embedded UI assets and a working repo-local `harness` binary.
- Missing-tool failures point contributors at the required `node`/`pnpm`
  installation step instead of failing later in `go build`.
- Documentation matches the new bootstrap order.

#### Execution Notes

Added `scripts/build-embedded-ui` as the shared local build entrypoint and made
`scripts/install-dev-harness` call it before rebuilding the repo-local binary.
Installer smoke fixtures now copy the frontend build inputs explicitly instead
of dragging local `node_modules` state into the test worktree.

#### Review Notes

NO_STEP_REVIEW_NEEDED: This automation slice was implemented and validated as
part of the same integrated generated-artifact contract change covered by the
Step 1 closeout review.

### Step 3: Move CI and release automation onto the same frontend-first build path

- Done: [x]

#### Objective

Teach repository automation to install frontend tooling, build the embedded UI
assets, and only then run Go tests or release packaging.

#### Details

The CI workflow and release workflow should gain the Node/pnpm setup required
to build `web/` deterministically from the committed lockfile, then run the
existing Go test/build stages against generated embedded assets. Release
packaging should continue producing a self-contained binary for end users, and
workflow-oriented tests should be updated if they assert the old Go-only shape.

#### Expected Files

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `scripts/build-release`
- `tests/smoke/homebrew_formula_test.go`
- `tests/smoke/release_build_test.go`

#### Validation

- CI builds frontend assets before `go test ./...`.
- Release automation builds frontend assets before release archives are
  produced.
- Existing workflow tests or new assertions verify the presence of the new
  frontend setup/build stages.

#### Execution Notes

Updated CI and release automation to install Node.js, enable Corepack, build
the embedded UI assets, and only then run Go tests or release packaging.
Release-workflow smoke assertions and checkout helpers now follow the same
frontend-first path.

#### Review Notes

NO_STEP_REVIEW_NEEDED: This automation slice was implemented and validated as
part of the same integrated generated-artifact contract change covered by the
Step 1 closeout review.

### Step 4: Prove the repository works without tracked bundle artifacts

- Done: [x]

#### Objective

Close the slice with repo-visible validation that the new contract works in the
same ways contributors and automation will use it.

#### Details

Validation should cover the frontend type/build path, local bootstrap, Go test
coverage, and at least one browser-level smoke path that exercises the embedded
UI served by the rebuilt binary. The final repository state should make it easy
for future contributors to understand that generated UI assets come from the
bootstrap/build pipeline rather than from checked-in bundle files.

#### Expected Files

- `docs/development.md`
- `scripts/ui-playwright-smoke`
- `docs/plans/active/2026-04-19-stop-tracking-embedded-ui-build-artifacts.md`

#### Validation

- `pnpm --dir web check` and the chosen frontend build command pass.
- `scripts/install-dev-harness` passes and produces a working local binary.
- `go test ./... -count=1` passes after the generated-asset transition.
- A UI smoke path against the rebuilt binary passes without relying on tracked
  bundle artifacts.

#### Execution Notes

Validated the generated-asset contract with `scripts/build-embedded-ui`,
`scripts/install-dev-harness`, `pnpm --dir web check`, `go test ./... -count=1`,
`scripts/build-release --version "v$(cat VERSION)" --output-dir
.local/release-ui-artifacts-check --platform "$(go env GOOS)/$(go env GOARCH)"`,
and `scripts/ui-playwright-smoke`. The post-review repair pass revalidated with
`go test ./tests/smoke -count=1`, `scripts/ui-playwright-smoke`, and
`go test ./... -count=1`.

#### Review Notes

NO_STEP_REVIEW_NEEDED: This validation slice is itself the repo-level proof for
the integrated generated-artifact contract change covered by the Step 1
closeout review.

## Validation Strategy

- Use the committed `web/pnpm-lock.yaml` as the single frontend dependency
  contract in local bootstrap and automation.
- Validate both the frontend source path (`pnpm --dir web check` plus frontend
  build) and the embedded-binary path (`scripts/install-dev-harness`,
  `go test ./... -count=1`, targeted UI smoke).
- Update workflow-oriented tests when automation shape changes so later agents
  get direct failure signals if the CI/release contract regresses.

## Risks

- Risk: A clean checkout may become confusing if contributors run Go commands
  before the frontend build prerequisites are satisfied.
  - Mitigation: make `scripts/install-dev-harness` the explicit local bootstrap
    path, emit actionable missing-tool/build guidance, and update developer
    docs to state the new contract clearly.
- Risk: CI/release could drift from local bootstrap and produce binaries with
  stale or missing embedded assets.
  - Mitigation: align local bootstrap, CI, and release around the same
    frontend-first build sequence and add workflow/test coverage for that
    sequence.
- Risk: Removing tracked bundles could accidentally break the current embed
  path or leave partially tracked generated files behind.
  - Mitigation: keep one canonical generated output location, remove tracked
    artifacts deliberately, and validate the rebuilt binary through UI smoke
    coverage before closeout.

## Validation Summary

UPDATE_REQUIRED_AFTER_REOPEN

Validated the generated-artifact contract through both source-path and
embedded-binary paths. Initial closeout validation covered
`pnpm --dir web check`, `scripts/build-embedded-ui`,
`scripts/install-dev-harness`, `go test ./internal/ui -count=1`,
`go test ./tests/smoke -count=1`, `go test ./... -count=1`,
`scripts/build-release --version "v$(cat VERSION)" --output-dir
.local/release-ui-artifacts-check --platform "$(go env GOOS)/$(go env GOARCH)"`,
and `scripts/ui-playwright-smoke`.

Review-driven repair validation reran `go test ./tests/smoke -count=1`,
`scripts/ui-playwright-smoke`, and `go test ./... -count=1` after the
shared-builder, fixture-cleanup, and workflow-ordering fixes. Finalize repair
validation then covered the missing-tool smoke cases directly with
`go test ./tests/smoke -run
'TestBuildEmbeddedUIScriptFailsWithActionableMessageWhen(NodeIsMissingButPnpmExists|PnpmIsMissing)$'
-count=1` followed by a full `go test ./tests/smoke -count=1`.

Revision 2 reopen validation now covers the post-archive publish repair:
`go test ./tests/smoke -run
'Test(CIWorkflowBuildsEmbeddedUIBeforeGoTests|ReleaseWorkflowWiresHomebrewTapPublishing)$'
-count=1`, `scripts/build-embedded-ui`,
`go test ./tests/smoke -run TestInstallDevHarnessVersionReportsStableModeAndPathOutsideWorktree -count=1`,
and `go test ./... -count=1` after merging `origin/main`.

## Review Summary

UPDATE_REQUIRED_AFTER_REOPEN

Step closeout review started with `review-001-full`, which requested five
blocking fixes around shared builder usage in Playwright smoke entrypoints,
actionable missing-`node` guidance, clean-checkout fixture proof, and
workflow-order assertions. Those repairs were reviewed in `review-002-delta`,
which passed with zero findings.

Finalize review then ran as `review-003-full`. That round found one blocking
tests issue and one minor docs-consistency issue: executable smoke coverage
still missed the `pnpm`-missing preflight, and the plan opening still led with
the retired `internal/ui/static/` path. The narrow finalize repair added the
missing `pnpm` smoke coverage and rewrote the opening language to foreground
`internal/ui/generated/build/`; `review-004-delta` passed with zero findings.

Revision 2 reopened after archive because post-archive CI on PR `#183` failed
before Go tests even started: `actions/setup-node` was asked to use `cache:
pnpm` before `pnpm` had been installed on the runner, and sync checking also
showed the branch was stale versus `origin/main` after the `v0.2.3` release
bump landed. Revision 2 repairs that publish-time regression by installing
`pnpm` explicitly in CI/release workflows, tightening workflow smoke
assertions around that contract, switching `scripts/build-embedded-ui` to run
inside `web/` so Corepack-backed `pnpm` resolves the pinned package-manager
version without network drift, and merging `origin/main` before the next
finalize review.

## Archive Summary

UPDATE_REQUIRED_AFTER_REOPEN

- Archived At: 2026-04-19T01:32:24+08:00
- Revision: 1
- PR: https://github.com/catu-ai/easyharness/pull/183
- Ready: Revision `1` archived successfully, but post-archive handoff surfaced
  two invalidators: CI on PR `#183` failed during runner setup because `pnpm`
  had not been installed before `actions/setup-node` attempted pnpm caching,
  and sync evidence showed the branch was stale versus `origin/main` after the
  `v0.2.3` release bump. Revision `2` repairs those issues and is pending a
  fresh finalize review plus re-archive.
- Merge Handoff: Complete revision `2` finalize review, re-archive the active
  plan, push the refreshed candidate to PR `#183`, and then refresh
  publish/CI/sync evidence for the new head before waiting for explicit merge
  approval.

The repository now treats `internal/ui/generated/build/` as generated output,
not tracked source. Contributors rebuild embedded assets through the shared
`scripts/build-embedded-ui` entrypoint, `scripts/install-dev-harness` prepares
those assets during local bootstrap, and CI/release workflows install Node,
enable Corepack, build the UI, and only then run Go tests or release
packaging.

Tracked minified bundle artifacts under `internal/ui/static/` are gone. The
durable repo contract is now enforced by updated docs, smoke/workflow tests,
release-checkout fixtures that clear inherited generated assets, and browser
smoke scripts that route through the same shared builder used elsewhere.

## Outcome Summary

### Delivered

UPDATE_REQUIRED_AFTER_REOPEN

- Removed tracked embedded UI bundle artifacts from git and moved the embed
  contract onto generated `internal/ui/generated/build/`.
- Added `scripts/build-embedded-ui` as the shared frontend build path for local
  bootstrap, browser smoke scripts, CI, and release automation.
- Added actionable missing-tool handling for both `node` and `pnpm`.
- Updated smoke/workflow coverage so clean-checkout fixtures and automation
  assertions exercise the generated-artifact contract directly.
- Updated the tracked plan and docs to reflect the generated-build contract and
  the review/repair history that closed it out.

### Not Delivered

UPDATE_REQUIRED_AFTER_REOPEN

- No runtime fallback rebuild path was added inside `harness ui` when generated
  embedded assets are missing.

### Follow-Up Issues

UPDATE_REQUIRED_AFTER_REOPEN

- #182: Consider fallback handling when generated embedded UI assets are
  missing at runtime.
