# Define Watchlist Unwatch Lifecycle

## Goal

Close the completed-versus-hidden lifecycle gap for watched worktrees by
settling on explicit `unwatch` terminology and behavior. A watched workspace
may be classified as `completed` by the dashboard read model, but clearing it
from the dashboard-owned watched set should be an explicit watchlist
membership-removal action, not a hidden dashboard state and not a harness
workflow archive.

This slice should leave future dashboard UI and API work with one durable
contract: `completed` is derived from harness status, while `unwatch` removes a
workspace from the machine-local watchlist without mutating harness workflow
state.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Tighten the watchlist and dashboard specs so #166 consistently uses
  `unwatch` rather than `hidden`, `hide`, or dashboard-local `archive`.
- Confirm that the dashboard `completed` rule remains the current read-model
  rule: readable status, `current_node: "idle"`, and last-landed context.
- Define `unwatch` as an explicit user action that removes a workspace record
  from `watchlist.json`.
- State that `unwatch` is dashboard/watchlist membership behavior only; it
  must not run `harness archive`, alter tracked plans, delete worktrees, or
  change workflow state.
- Add or adjust focused tests if existing docs or contracts are backed by
  generated schema, contract sync, or dashboard/watchlist behavior assertions.
- Leave a GitHub-visible closeout note for #166 explaining the accepted
  terminology and any deferred implementation surface.

### Out of Scope

- Building the dashboard frontend UI.
- Adding the `harness dashboard` CLI entrypoint.
- Implementing a full workspace detail route.
- Automatically removing completed, stale, missing, or invalid workspaces.
- Introducing a persisted `hidden` flag or any separate hidden lifecycle
  state.
- Changing harness workflow semantics, including `harness archive`.
- Deleting local repositories, git worktrees, plan files, or `.local/harness`
  artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The tracked specs consistently describe `completed` as a derived
      dashboard lifecycle state rather than persisted watchlist state.
- [ ] The tracked specs define `unwatch` as explicit watchlist membership
      removal from `watchlist.json`.
- [ ] The tracked specs clearly state that `unwatch` does not call or mean
      `harness archive`.
- [ ] The tracked specs state that completed workspaces do not automatically
      age out or disappear in v1.
- [ ] Any existing references to dashboard-local hide/archive semantics are
      either removed or reframed as historical/deferred wording.
- [ ] If implementation work is needed in this slice, focused watchlist or
      dashboard tests prove the new behavior without changing workflow state.
- [ ] Issue #166 has a closeout comment or PR note summarizing the accepted
      `unwatch` direction.

## Deferred Items

- Implement the concrete dashboard/API `unwatch` write path if this slice only
  lands the normative contract.
- Add the frontend control that lets a user unwatch a completed workspace from
  the dashboard home.

## Work Breakdown

### Step 1: Tighten the completed and unwatch contract

- Done: [x]

#### Objective

Update the durable watchlist/dashboard documentation so a future agent can
understand #166 without reading discovery chat.

#### Details

Keep the existing completed classification rule from the dashboard read model:
`completed` is derived when status is readable, `current_node` is `idle`, and
status artifacts include last-landed context. Replace any remaining dashboard
`hidden`, `hide`, or `archive` language with `unwatch` unless the wording is
explicitly describing a rejected alternative.

`Unwatch` should be specified as membership removal from the machine-local
watchlist. It should not become another lifecycle enum value, because removed
items are no longer watched entries in the dashboard read model.

#### Expected Files

- `docs/specs/watchlist-contract.md`
- `docs/specs/proposals/harness-ui-steering-surface.md`
- `docs/specs/index.md` if the specs index needs a wording update

#### Validation

- `git diff --check -- docs/specs/watchlist-contract.md docs/specs/proposals/harness-ui-steering-surface.md docs/specs/index.md`
- Reread the updated docs and confirm the terms `hidden` and dashboard-local
  `archive` are not used as current behavior for watched workspace clearing.

#### Execution Notes

Updated the watchlist contract and dashboard steering proposal so `completed`
remains a derived dashboard lifecycle state, completed entries stay watched
until explicit `unwatch`, and `unwatch` is defined as watchlist membership
removal only. Validation: `git diff --check -- docs/specs/watchlist-contract.md
docs/specs/proposals/harness-ui-steering-surface.md docs/specs/index.md`;
`rg -n "hidden|hide|dashboard-local archive|age out|age-out|automatic"
docs/specs/watchlist-contract.md
docs/specs/proposals/harness-ui-steering-surface.md`.

#### Review Notes

`review-001-delta` requested one docs-consistency fix: the Missing or
Unreadable Workspaces section still used old deferred membership-removal
wording. Reworded that section to say entries remain until explicit `unwatch`
removes them. `review-002-delta` passed with no findings.

### Step 2: Decide whether this slice needs a tiny unwatch write path

- Done: [ ]

#### Objective

Either implement the smallest watchlist-level `unwatch` behavior now or record
the exact follow-up implementation issue if the contract-only closeout is the
right boundary.

#### Details

Prefer implementation only if the existing code shape makes the write path
truly small and isolated: a watchlist service method that removes one canonical
workspace record from `watchlist.json`, preserves unrelated records, uses the
same home resolution and lock/atomic-write discipline as `Touch`, and does not
touch workflow state.

If that expands beyond a small isolated watchlist change, defer it explicitly
and leave #166 as the contract-definition closeout rather than smuggling UI or
CLI work into this plan.

#### Expected Files

- `internal/watchlist/watchlist.go` if implementing
- `internal/watchlist/watchlist_test.go` if implementing
- GitHub issue or PR body note if deferring implementation

#### Validation

- If implementing: `go test ./internal/watchlist -count=1`
- If deferring: a concrete follow-up issue or PR note names the intended
  `unwatch` implementation surface and explains why #166 remains
  contract-only.

#### Execution Notes

Implemented the small isolated watchlist write path in this slice:
`watchlist.Service.Unwatch` removes one selected workspace record from
`watchlist.json`, preserves unrelated records, uses the same home resolution,
lock, and atomic rewrite helpers as `Touch`, supports missing workspace rows
by matching their persisted path, leaves absent records as no-ops without
creating an empty watchlist, and does not touch harness workflow state.
Validation: red `go test ./internal/watchlist -run Unwatch -count=1` failed
before implementation because `Service.Unwatch` did not exist; green
`go test ./internal/watchlist -count=1` passed after implementation and the
no-op refinement.

#### Review Notes

PENDING_STEP_REVIEW

### Step 3: Close the GitHub-facing handoff

- Done: [ ]

#### Objective

Make the accepted `unwatch` decision visible on #166 or in the PR body so the
issue does not depend on hidden chat context.

#### Details

The closeout note should state the final terms plainly:

- `completed` is derived from status returning to `idle` with last-landed
  context.
- completed entries remain watched until explicit user action.
- that action is called `unwatch`.
- `unwatch` removes watchlist membership only and is unrelated to
  `harness archive`.
- v1 has no automatic age-out or garbage collection.

#### Expected Files

- No repository files are required for this step unless the PR body is the
  chosen handoff surface.

#### Validation

- The issue comment or PR note can be read without discovery chat and explains
  why #166 is ready to close or what implementation issue remains.

#### Execution Notes

PENDING_STEP_EXECUTION

#### Review Notes

PENDING_STEP_REVIEW

## Validation Strategy

- Lint the tracked plan before approval.
- Run doc whitespace checks for touched markdown specs.
- If a watchlist write path is implemented, run focused watchlist tests and
  include regression cases for preserving unrelated records, idempotent
  removal of absent records, and no workflow-state mutation.
- Before archive, reread the issue and updated specs to confirm #166's
  acceptance criteria are answered by tracked artifacts rather than chat.

## Risks

- Risk: `unwatch` could be confused with workflow archival or worktree
  deletion.
  - Mitigation: Keep the contract wording explicit that `unwatch` only removes
    watchlist membership and does not mutate harness workflow state or files in
    the watched repository.
- Risk: A hidden-state compromise could creep back in as a persisted flag.
  - Mitigation: State that removed items are no longer in the watched set, and
    do not add a `hidden` lifecycle value.
- Risk: The plan could expand into dashboard UI work.
  - Mitigation: Keep UI controls and routing out of scope unless a later
    approved plan takes them on.
